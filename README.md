| 2021 | **On Lower Bounds on the Competitiveness for the Online Facility Location Problem and its Multi-commodity Extension** | Facility Location (FL) is a widely applicable optimization problem in computational geometry dealing with the optimal placement and opening of facilities in order to serve some set of clients under minimal cost. Service costs based on the client-facility distance, and construction costs for opening new facilities influence the overall cost function. In the Multi-commodity extension of the problem called Multi-commodity Facility Location (MCFL), clients can additionally ask for a subset of commodities which needs to be served by a number of possibly multiple facilities jointly. We regard the online versions of both problems in which client request locations are not known in advance and analyse both problems under the notion of Competitive Analysis (CA). In our findings, we present two lower-bounds on the Competitive Ratios (CRs). Any randomized online algorithm for Online Facility Location can not be better than <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Omega(\frac{log~n}{log~log~n}) " /> -competitive against an oblivious adversary, even if the problem is defined in a line-segment metric space. With <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?S" /> denoting the set of all commodities, no randomized algorithm for the Online Multi-commodity Facility Location Problem can be better than <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Omega(\sqrt{\vert S \vert} + \frac{log~n}{log~log~n})" /> -competitive against an oblivious adversary on the line segment. We prove lower-bounds by providing malicious request sequence distributions and conclude by arguing tightness of the lower-bounds based on existing algorithms for the problems. |

| 2020 | **Real-time Fast Moving Object Tracking in Air Hockey** | Tracking objects in videos in real-time is a challenging task, especially if the objects that are to be tracked are small and move at fast speed. In air hockey games, tracking the air hockey puck is such a difficult problem. Still, for an air hockey playing robot, estimating the position and trajectory of a puck from video data is the only viable approach. In this paper, we present three real-time approaches to air hockey puck tracking based on computer vision only. We provide a detailed introduction and a critical evaluation of the approaches, aiming at selecting an algorithm most suitable to be implemented in an actual air hockey robot. The approaches are chosen to differ distinctly in the underlying principles and assumptions. This is to give a broad view of various puck tracking principles. For example, two approaches use the pucks location in multiple consecutive frames to derive the pucks trajectory, while another approach solely relies on the motion blur visible in a single image to estimate the trajectory. Next to the motion blur based approach, we present one approach using classical computer vision algorithms and another one based on a deep convolutional neural network object detector. Our results show that out of the three algorithms, there is no such thing as the best approach to air hockey puck tracking caused by a huge variety of gameplay situations in which one approach may perform better than the other two. |
| 2020 | **Advanced Vision Architectures: Hourglass Networks and CornerNet** | The current developments in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), together with the availability of massive amounts of labeled data and computational possibilities, led to a paradigm shift in Computer Vision. This shift also heavily influenced object detection, where Deep CNNs achieve competitive results on benchmark datasets like COCO. In the subclass of one-shot detectors, object detectors which rely on a single pass through the network, anchor box approaches recently marked the state-of-the-art. However, the choice of anchor boxes is heavily influencing the networks performance and is often a difficult task in terms of choosing suitable hyperparameters for the one-shot detectors. To overcome the hyperparameter choices, inherent in anchor box approaches, Law et al. proposed the CornerNet CNN, which tackles the task of object detection as a keypoint-estimation problem. Relying on a stacked-hourglass architecture, the network predicts the upper-left and bottom-right coordinate for an object bounding box. In this paper, we train a fast successor called CornerNet-Squeeze on an object tracking dataset called NICO-OI, which is a collection of labeled videos of robot- object interactions. Our results show that CornerNet-Squeeze can successfully be trained on the NICO-OI dataset for object detection, reaching an AP score of 0.9. Further, we observe that the network nicely deals with occlusions and in-plane rotations, partly memorizing object shapes and inferencing about object positions. Our findings let us conclude that CornerNet-Squeeze can be applied on the NICO robot for object detection. |

| 2019 | **Deep reinforcement learning for mobile robot control task** | Reinforcement Learning is a paradigm of Machine Learning that is about building competitive agents by letting them interact with an environment. This learning is inspired by how humans congregate knowledge about how to act in specific situations from feedback emitted from the environment. It appears natural to apply this kind of learning to robots that are to learn how to solve specific tasks in the real world. Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning combine classical Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms with Deep Learning, creating a subfield called Deep Reinforcement Learning. This approach provides a powerful framework for a variety of task like learning to play Atari games or learning to play the game of Go. Unfortunately, some of these algorithms, especially most value-based algorithms are not working very well with high-dimensional, continuous action spaces, as often found in robotic domains. This is why the class of Policy Gradient-based algorithms has been proposed, giving some advantages over classical value-based approaches. In this survey, we investigate and analyse a specific field of Policy Gradient- based methods, called Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithms. A selection of algorithms from this class will be evaluated and critically compared. The comparison is based on the use of these algorithms in the context of a mobile robot control task, whose implementation is documented in a paper parallel to this survey. The results focus on the theoretical aspects of the algorithms, supported by practical evaluation found in other papers. Findings suggest that in most cases, an algorithm called Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient is to be preferred when applying Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithms, for example in the context of a mobile robot.  |
| 2018 | **OpenTracing and Extraction of Architectural Information**  | Traces in software systems are representations of the control flow of an execution, typically captured in the context of a dynamic program analysis. These can contain, next to other data, information about the method execution, timing, and the hierarchy of called methods. Information provided by execution traces may help application performance monitoring (APM) tools and software performance engineering (SPE) approaches to extract the software architecture of a system, measure the performance of an application or identify problems. Unfortunately, most APM tools rely on different tracing formats, which makes it difficult to achieve compatibility among different APM tools. The OpenTracing format tries to solve this by offering an open source tracing format that can be used throughout multiple concrete tracing implementations. One of these tracing implementations is given by the Kieker framework, a dynamic analysis tool enabling APM. Kieker can be used by the SLAstic framework, an approach for online capacity management in distributed software systems allowing continuous monitoring and analyzing, to enable the extraction of architectural information based on tracing data. This paper provides a comparison of OpenTracing with different tracing formats, including Kieker. We present a way to transform the OpenTracing format into Kieker, which allows to analyze traces from OpenTracing with the Kieker framework and the SLAstic framework.
